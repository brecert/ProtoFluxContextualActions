# ProtoFlux Contextual Actions

ProtoFlux Contextual Actions is a mod that add additional context menu actions for different contexts that revolve around protoflux.

Bug report welcome, and feel free to create an issue for any actions that you want added.

## Patches
There are currently three patches.

### Contextual Actions
Adds 'Contextual Actions' to the ProtoFlux Tool. The secondary press while holding a protoflux tool will be open a context menu of quick actions based on what wire you're dragging instead of always spawning an input node. Pressing secondary again will spawn out an input node like normal.

### Contextual Swap Actions
Adds 'Contextual Swapping Actions' to the ProtoFlux Tool. Double pressing secondary pointing at a node with protoflux tool will be open a context menu of actions to swap the node for another node.

This patch is disabled by default and is expirimental, it's been tricky to get right. Assume there may be potential bugs from usage if enabled.

### DynamicVariableInput Creation
Adds a context menu item to create DynamicVariableInputs when holding a dynamic variable component with the ProtoFlux tool.
